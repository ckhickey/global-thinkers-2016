    <p>As a young epidemiologist researching the causes of vision disorders and prevalent diseases like glaucoma, Dr. Alfred Sommer went to Indonesia in the 1970s to investigate rising incidences of night blindness in children. Sommer discovered that children’s diets, deficient in vitamin A, were causing their eyesight to erode and making them more susceptible to pediatric illnesses like measles. He later found that vitamin A deficiency in pregnant women increases both maternal and infant mortality rates. Sommer’s discovery that simple vitamin A capsules could save the lives of millions of mothers and children led to one of the most efficient and effective interventions in the history of modern medicine. Owing directly to his work, governments and aid organizations have been distributing vitamin A supplements—at a cost of two to three cents per dose—all over the world <a href="https://www.unicef.org/immunization/index_control.html">since 1997</a>. As a result, child mortality among the most at-risk populations has <a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/news/stories/2003/sommer-vita.html">fallen by 23 to 34 percent</a>, preventing up to a million deaths each year, and up to 400,000 new cases of blindness each year. For this work, Sommer received the Lasker Award—one of the highest honors in the field of medicine—for clinical medical research in 1997. He went on to chair the board of directors of the Lasker Foundation, which names the yearly honorees. “The awards further underscore the ways in which research advances deepen our knowledge of the fundamentals of biology and have had a transformative effect upon the lives and health of people all over the world,” he <a href="http://news.yale.edu/2011/09/12/yales-horwich-wins-lasker-award-one-sciences-top-honors">said</a> in 2011. Sommer is a professor of ophthalmology at the Wilmer Eye Institute and a distinguished service professor, dean emeritus, and professor of epidemiology and international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. He was dean of the school from 1990 to 2005, serving as one of the nation’s leading public health advocates and steering its premier global health institution. At the heart of the ethos that’s driven his 40-year career is his belief in the power of public health to save lives.<em> (Photo credit: BRYAN BEDDER/Getty Images for Helen Keller International)</em></p>
